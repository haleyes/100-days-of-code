**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Today's Progress**: Sign up for #100daysofcode, put together a curriculum and game plan, let Fullstack Academy know I wasn't prepared, yet, to apply. Posted my committment on Twitter and wrote a blog post on Medium.

**Thoughts**: Have not felt motivated since Monday. Too much on my brain, too many open loops. Need to bullet journal and figure out my work and coding priorities.
