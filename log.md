# 100 Days Of Code - Log + Journal: Round 1

### Day 0: February 20, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Sign up for #100daysofcode, put together a curriculum and game plan, let Fullstack Academy know I wasn't prepared, yet, to apply. Posted my committment on Twitter and wrote a blog post on Medium.

**Thoughts**: Have not felt motivated since Monday. Too much on my brain, too many open loops. Need to bullet journal and figure out my work and coding priorities. Not sure if I made this repo correctly, hope I didn't fuck anything up LOL.
